        <p>I am a student journalist born and raised in Jackson Heights, New York. I have a bachelor's degree in Mass communications, but was never really sure what to do next. I found I really enjoyed writing and radio, so I decided to pursue journalism here at Craig Newmark. I am excited for this journey! </p>
